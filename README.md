# Classification of different types of (toy) dinosaurs using CNNs
- Saved 120 images of 4 different toy dinosaurs (plus 120 images for empty & hand_only class) using a webcam and this [script](https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier)
- Built i) CNN from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras (optimzed the model using SciKeras to do grid search) and built ii) a CNN based on the mobilenet CNN using transfer learning approach (further optimized through image augmentation)  
- Customized the [script](https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier) used for image generation (based on OpenCV) to live predict dinosaurs held into the camera
