# Classifying different types of dinosaurs using CNNs
- Saved 120 images of 4 different dinosaurs (plus 120 images for empty & hand_only class) using my webcam and this [script](https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier)
- Built i) CNN from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras - optimzed the model using SciKeras (enabling grid search) and ii) a CNN based on the mobilenet CNN using transfer learning approach, further optimized through image (augmentation)  
- Customized the [script](https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier) used for image generation to live predict dinosaurs shown into the camera
