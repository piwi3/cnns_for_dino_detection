# Classification of (toy) dinosaurs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Generated __120 images__ of __4 different toy dinosaurs__ (plus 120 images for 'empty' & 'hand only' class) using a webcam and this [script](https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier)
- Built __i) CNN from scratch__ using __TensorFlow and Keras__ (optimzed the model using __SciKeras__ to do grid search) and built __ii) a CNN based on the mobilenet CNN__ using __transfer learning__ approach (further optimized through image augmentation)  
- Customized the [script](https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier) used for image generation (based on __OpenCV__) to __live predict toy dinosaurs__ held into the camera
